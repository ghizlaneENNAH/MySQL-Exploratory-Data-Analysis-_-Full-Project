# Data Cleaning and Analysis SQL Project

This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL. The dataset contains information about layoffs in various companies, including details such as the number of employees laid off, industry, country, and funding.

## Project Files

- **`Data_Cleaning_SQLProject.sql`** â€“ SQL scripts for cleaning and preparing the dataset.
- **`layoffs.csv`** â€“ The raw dataset used for analysis.
- **`Exploratory_Data_Analysis.sql`** â€“ SQL queries for analyzing trends in layoffs.

## Steps in the Project

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies.  
   - Standardized column formats.  
   - Removed duplicates and incorrect data entries.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed layoffs by company, industry, and country.  
   - Examined trends over time using aggregate functions.  
   - Used window functions to compute rolling totals and rankings.  

## How to Use

1. Load the dataset into a SQL database.  
2. Run the **Data Cleaning SQL script** to prepare the data.  
3. Execute the **EDA SQL script** to analyze the trends in layoffs.  

## Tools Used

- MySQL 
- SQL Window Functions  
- Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)
